summary: '"Winged Warfare: Hunting the Huns in the Air" by William Avery Bishop is
  an autobiographical account of aerial combat written in the early 20th century.
  It chronicles the experiences of Major Bishop, a decorated pilot in the Royal Flying
  Corps during World War I, as he describes his transition from cavalry to the thrilling,
  perilous world of aerial warfare. The narrative captures the excitement and dangers
  faced by pilots over the Western Front, including combat with enemy aircraft and
  critical support for ground troops.  The opening of the book sets the stage for
  Bishop''s military journey, starting from a muddy cavalry camp in England where
  an unexpected encounter with a flying machine inspires him to become an aviator.
  He reflects on his training as an observer and the dichotomy between the drudgery
  of reconnaissance and the exhilaration of fighting in the air. It introduces his
  ambitions and experiences as he makes the leap from a passive role to actively engaging
  in the war as a pilot, eagerly anticipating his first chance to fight against the
  enemy in the skies. This opening portion not only establishes his desire for adventure
  but also paints a vivid picture of the early days of air combat and the profound
  shift in warfare during that era. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
